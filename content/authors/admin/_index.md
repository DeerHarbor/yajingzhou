Yajing Zhou is a PhD student (2023/10 – present) at King’s College London. She focuses primarily on how Aβ and tau affect brain structure and function in people with Down syndrome. She is currently involved in the projects London Down Syndrome Consortium (LonDownS) and GO-DS21. Projects concern detailed cognitive phenotyping of individuals with Down across the lifespan, and tracking change with ageing using MR, EEG and fNIRS neuroimaging, and includes identification of plasma biomarkers of cognitive decline using markers related to inflammation, amyloid, neurodegeneration, and oxidative stress.

Yajing has almost 1.5 years of experience as a research assistant, and she worked as an intern in two hospitals. Therefore, she is adept at interacting with patients of all ages, especially the elderly (cognition unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease), and patients with Down Syndrome. On top of that, she has very extensive experience in data collection, data analysis, and recruitment.
