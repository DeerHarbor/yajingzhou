Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that represents the most common cause of dementia and the fifth leading cause of death globally. Deep Brain stimulation has been frequently shown to treat mental problems and increase cognitive function in AD patients. However, sufficient evidence for DBS's effectiveness in treating neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD remains unclear. I propose to assess the efficacy of employing deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat cognitive functions and neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with AD. Six databases were systematically searched using phrases linked to "Alzheimer’s disease or Alzheimer disease ", "neuropsychiatric symptoms", and "deep brain stimulation". The selected randomised controlled trials were evaluated using the CASP quality assessment and Cochrane risk of bias instruments. Seven papers that satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria were chosen. In all studies, deep brain stimulation might be resulted in substantial improvements in cognitive functions compared to the control group. Also, the observed adverse events were acceptable since only minor side effects occurred and vanished before the conclusion of therapy. However, the efficacy of DBS for treating AD patients’ neuropsychiatric symptoms need to further explore. Also, small sample sizes precluded all research from achieving statistical significance, indicating that treating cognitive functions and neuropsychiatric symptoms using DBS in Alzheimer’s disease might not be a simple process. More research with a broader patient population is required.
